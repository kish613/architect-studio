Transform this 2D floorplan into a photorealistic 3D architectural visualization.

CRITICAL: You MUST follow the EXACT layout shown in the reference floorplan image:
- Match the EXACT room positions, shapes, and proportions from the floorplan
- Preserve ALL wall positions and angles exactly as shown
- Keep room sizes PROPORTIONAL to what is shown in the floorplan
- The rooms are: [dynamic room list]

Create an isometric cutaway view of this SINGLE FLOOR layout with walls cut at eye level to reveal the interior.

LAYOUT ACCURACY (MOST IMPORTANT):
- [wallLayout from analysis]
- [description from analysis]
- Each room must be enclosed with walls matching the floorplan boundaries
- Bathrooms must be their own separate enclosed rooms (not open areas)
- Room dimensions: [roomDimensions from analysis]

USER STYLE PREFERENCES:
[userStyle or default: "modern minimalist interior, neutral colors, clean aesthetic"]

Style rendering:
- Apply the user's style preferences to all furniture, decor, and finishes
- Natural lighting from windows (place windows where shown in floorplan)
- Furniture SCALED appropriately for each room size
- Unreal Engine 5 quality, professional architectural rendering
- Soft global illumination and realistic shadows

CRITICAL FOR 3D MODEL CONVERSION (follow these EXACTLY):
- SOLID PURE WHITE BACKGROUND (#FFFFFF) - no gradients, no shadows on background
- Single clear architectural subject with sharply defined edges and corners
- ZERO text, watermarks, labels, or annotations anywhere
- HIGH CONTRAST: Dark shadows, bright highlights, clear material boundaries
- CLEAN TEXTURES: Smooth surfaces, no noise, no film grain, no post-processing effects
- SHARP FOCUS: Crystal clear details on all furniture, walls, and architectural elements
- NO atmospheric effects: No fog, haze, dust particles, lens flare, or bloom
- SOLID COLORS: Use distinct solid colors for different surfaces (walls, floors, furniture)
- DEFINED EDGES: Every object should have clear, sharp boundaries
- CONSISTENT LIGHTING: Even, studio-style lighting without harsh shadows on the model
- 4K QUALITY, photorealistic materials, ultra-high resolution textures
